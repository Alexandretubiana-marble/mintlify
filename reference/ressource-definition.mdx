It contains an `outcome`, as well as details (`scenario`, `score`, `rules`) that you can use to trigger specific actions in your application.

| Attribute                                      | Description                                                                                                                       |

| **scenario***object(scenario)*                 | Scenario that was executed. See [scenario](#scenario).                                                                            |
| **rules***array\[rule]*                        | Array of rules executed in the scenario. See [rule](#rule).                                                                       |
| **score***int*                                 | Score computed by the scenario (sum of all `score_modifier` of rules that evaluated to`true`). Only present if `outcome != null`. |
| **scheduled\_scenario\_execution\_id***string* | ID of the scheduled scenario execution. Only present if the decision was created by a scheduled scenario execution                |

### scenario

***

The `scenario` shows details about the scenario executed.

This is mainly useful to display its information in a third-party system, like a case manager.

| Attribute                           | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **id***string*                      | ID of the scenario.                                            |
| **name***string*                    | Name of the scenario.                                          |
| **description***string*             | Description of the scenario.                                   |
| **scenario\_iteration\_id***string* | Unique identifier of the scenario version use in this decision |
| **version***string*                 | Version of the scenario.                                       |

### rule

***

The `rule` provides all the detail of the rules that were computed to produce an outcome.

This is mainly useful to display its information in a third-party system, like a case manager.

| Attribute                | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **name***string*         | Name of the rule.                                           |
| **description***string*  | Description of the rule.                                    |
| **score\_modifier***int* | If the rule is true, this is added to the scenario's score. |
| **result***bool*         | Did the rule evaluate to true or false ?                    |
| **rule\_id***string*     | Unique identifier of the rule version used in this decision |
| **error***object*        | Error when executing the rule. See [error](#error).         |

### error

***

The `error` provides more context when a scenario was not able to produce an outcome, or a rule was not able to produce a score.

Note that `error == null` if Marble was able to produce an outcome (ie when `decision.outcome != null`).

| Attribute           | Description                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **code***int*       | Machine-readable error code.  |
| **message***string* | Human-readable error message. |

Possible errors on the `decision` object:

| code | message                                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 100  | Scenario was not able to compute a score because all rules failed. |

Possible errors on the `rule` object:

| code | message                                             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | A field (\{field name}) in rule is empty or missing |
