String templating function is used to create a dynamic text by using variables, computed at the decision execution time. The variables in the template are delimited by the "percent" sign `%`.

For example, in the following text: `"Case for transaction: %object_id%"`, `%object_id%` is used to denote a variable, whose value will be computed dynamically when the decision is created, according to a choice of value that you make in the template builder.

Every variable in your template string is detected and appears next to a field selector, similar to the one used in the rule builder.
