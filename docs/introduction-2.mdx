Marble is an open-source, real-time decision engine for fintech, banks, marketplaces, telco and more. Our philosophy is to empower and help you to create rules based on the business data that makes sense in **your** context.

Launching a new payment rail that involves some non-standard data? Marble has you covered. Implementing business rules for eligibility to a product? Marble has you covered.

The upshot is that you need to setup your data model - that is as close as possible to the data your team is used to reason on - before you create your first rules.

<Info>
  We understand that starting with this abstraction right as you put your hands on the tool may be more than a bit intimidating. In fact, getting your data model right is hard - not just in Marble. So if you're just getting started, we propose you an example data [model](/docs/example-data-model) that should be complete enough to let you explore all the main features available in Marble. We suggest you try it out and edit a first scenario, following our ([link](/docs/implementing-marble-at-my-company-copy-copy-copy)). Once you're done, you should be better prepared to consider what data and rules you want to use in production.

In the following pages, we will run you through the details of how to:

* Create your tables (business entities) that you want to use to ingest data and make decisions
* Populate the entities with fields (attributes)
* Define relationships between entities
* Ingest data, in real-time by API or in batch

We'll also cover some advanced topic, such as how to define a "pivot value" to group all decisions on different object types by a shared parent entity ID.
