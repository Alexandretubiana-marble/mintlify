# Operators

Timestamps represent the absolute position in time of two events. They can be compared to check if a timestamp is equal to another, greater (or equal) than another, or lesser (or equal) than another.

Concretely, timestamp comparison operations involve using the usual comparison operators (like `<`, `>`) to determine the relationship between two values. For example:

* `timestamp_1 < timestamp_2` : True if `timestamp_1` is before `timestamp_2`.
* `timestamp_1 > timestamp_2` : True if `timestamp_1` is after `timestamp_2`.

Valid conditions must evaluate to `true` or `false`, so you cannot add or subtract timestamp values (`timestamp_1 - timestamp_2` is not valid), though you can use [the date function](/docs/now-copy) to shift a timestamp by a duration.

# Examples

1. Check if `updated_at` falls within the past 7 days
