Largely, everything that was explained in the page [Create fields in a table](/docs/create-fields-in-a-table) remains true.

Some differences should noted on making an existing field unique post-creation. Enforcing uniqueness on an existing field takes a while (the time it takes for the database to create a unicity index), and the operation can fail if there already exist duplicate values in the ingested data.

If you want to make a field unique and the update fails, reach out to us: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b8dbd7d6ccd9dbccf8dbd0dddbd3d5d9cadad4dd96dbd7d5) (or resolve the issues in the marble DB if you are using our open-source offering).
