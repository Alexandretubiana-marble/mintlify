You can set up the webhook endpoints from the settings page, as an admin user.

To do so, you will at least need an endpoint. You should preferably use an https url to deliver your webhooks.

<Warning>
  The endpoint URL you configure must be reachable when you configure a new endpoint. A GET request will be sent to test its reachability. It is OK if the request returns a 4XX status, but the endpoint creation will fail if the request fails.
</Warning>

Additionally, you can select which of the available webhook event types you want to deliver to this endpoint (by default: send all events), and choose a timeout duration for your endpoint (any webhook delivery that has not responded after this duration will be retried).

Once the endpoint is set up, you can read the endpoints secret value in the details panel. You will need this to verify incoming webhooks (see the [receiving webhooks](/docs/receiving-webhooks) section). Store it somewhere safe.

You can also delete an existing webhook endpoint from the details page.
