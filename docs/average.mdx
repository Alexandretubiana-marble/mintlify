# Definition

A variable is built with several components:

* **Name**: A label displayed in the builder to identify the variable
* **Function**: The method used to process and combine (aggregate) the selected data
* **Field**: The specific data field used to perform the computation (sum, average...)
* **Optional Filter(s)**: List of criteria used to select a relevant subset of your data

### List of supported functions and their descriptions:

| Function       | Description                                    | Default if no rows found |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Average        | Calculates the mean value of a set of numbers. | NULL                     |
| Count          | Counts the total number of items.              | 0                        |
| Count distinct | Counts the number of unique items.             | 0                        |
| Max            | Finds the highest value.                       | NULL                     |
| Min            | Finds the lowest value.                        | NULL                     |
| Sum            | Adds up all the values.                        | 0                        |

# Example

Suppose we want to check if the average payout transaction over the last 7 days exceeds €15,000. Here’s how we can achieve this:

1. **Select the Function:** Choose the "Average" function to calculate the mean value of the payout transactions.

2. **Choose a name for the variable**: it does not impact how it's computed, but will help make your rule more readable in the builder
3. **Choose an aggregation function**: the type of aggregation that you want to compute
4. **Choose an entity and field to aggregate on**: Choose the target field on which you want to aggregate. You will be able to add filters on this table's field in the following step
5. **Add filters**: Add the relevant filters that you want to filter on, on the target field table.

6. **Save and View:** After saving, the variable will be displayed in the builder, showing the specified condition.

# Filters

## Available options

Filters work similarly to comparison operators in the formula, but with some limitations specific to how they are used.

They work in the context of a *target table*, that is to say the table (or data model entity) whose field we want to aggregate.

* The left-hand field *must* be a reference to a field from the *target table*, while the right-hand field can take any value allowed in the builder (except nested aggregate variables)

* Most of the operators from the ruile builder are available in aggregates filters. You can still use operators like `>`, `=`,`<` etc, as well as the `is in list` and `is not in list` operators.

  * **Numeric operators:** `>`, `=`,`<` etc
  * **List operators:** `is in list` and `is not in list`
  * **Empty checks:** `is empy` and `is not empty`
  * **Text operators:** `starts with`, `ends with` and `is similar to`
    <Info>
      The `is similar to` operator works the same way as the *String similarity* function in the rule builder. For a detailed walkthrough, see [String similarity](/docs/string-similarity-scoring-copy).

## Necessity of using filters

It is almost always important to specify a sufficient set of filters in the variable, so that the aggregation can be computed quickly. Marble will make sure to index the values as best as possible to ensure a quick computation, but an aggregate that averages over all values in the database is bound to be slow, and may lead to critically slow response times and/or timeouts.

See below an anti-pattern and an improvement on it.

## Example

Let’s say we’d like to check if the creditor name, indicated by the emitter of a transfer, matches at least one the aliases registered by our customer.

1. **Create an aggregate:** create a count aggregate, that will count aliases' object IDs.
2. **Compare to creditor name:** use the `similar to`operator to compare the aliases full name with the transaction creditor name. Here, we will prefer the « bag of words » (see [String similarity](/docs/string-similarity-scoring-copy#token-set-ratio)) comparison with a high sensitivity
3. **Set the hit condition:** here, we want the rule to be triggered if no matches are found, so we select the `=`operator with value 0.
