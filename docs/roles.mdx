The publisher can create new scenario versions from a draft, set them live, revert to a previous scenario version and create a test run.

The admin can

* Access the settings and create users, API keys, webhooks settings

There is a dedicated rights management for the **case manager**. Once the inbox are created by an Admin, another user can be designated as Inbox Admin. The Inbox Admin can add / remove users from its inbox.
