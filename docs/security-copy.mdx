# Access and organizational security

* **Authentication**: we have Single Sign On (SSO), 2-factor authentication (2FA) and strong password policies to ensure access to Marble’s cloud services and SaaS are protected.

* **Password Managers**: all company-issued laptops have a password manager in place for team members to manage passwords and maintain password best practices.

* **Permissions**: access to cloud infrastructure and other sensitive tools are limited to authorized employees who require it for their role.

* **Security policy deployed** (for travels, out-of-office work, in-office practices, laptop configurations, and encryption)

* **Least privileged access control**:

  * Production account is only accessible by Senior DevOps employees, on a need-to-do basis
  * No manual access for ordinary operations
  * Minimally scoped permissions for apps running

# Internal technical security

* **Security hardening**: Policy of least necessary privilege, reduction of attack surface
* **Web application firewall**: all traffic transits through a load balancer with Cloud Armor WAF enabled
* **Static code scanning** (library vulnerabilities with Dependabot, secret scanning, github CodeQL + Bearer SAST) and **docker images scanning** (GCP Artifact registry)
* **Third-party penetration testing**: we work with independent security consultants to conduct regular penetration tests on all parts of our system.
* **Auditability** (log trails)
