Lists serve as custom data sources necessary for creating Rule. They can be utilized in multiple contexts, and their values can be managed independently of the Scenario's lifecycle. This necessitates the introduction of a distinct concept.

More information on the usage of lists can be found [in the Scenarios section](/docs/lists-in-scenario-builder).
