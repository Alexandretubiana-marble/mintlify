# Definition

Despite its name, the `Date` function operates on, and returns, timestamps. It is used to shift timestamps by an interval of seconds, minutes, hours or days, to the past or the future.

The `Date` function comprises several essential components:

* **Date**: The reference point upon which the function operates. It can either be a static date or a dynamic one, such as [Now](/docs/count)).
* **Operation**: It involves either adding or subtracting a specific period of time.

<Info>
  Date comparison operations involve using comparison operators (like `<`, `>`) to determine the relationship between two dates. For example:

  * `date1 < date2`: True if `date1` is before `date2`.
  * `date1 > date2`: True if `date1` is after `date2`.

  These operations help in determining the relative order of dates.

# Example

Let's say we aim to verify whether the transaction date falls within the past 7 days.

1. **Select the Function**: Choose the "Date" function to compute the date from 7 days ago.

2. **Create the date**: Use the dedicated modal to compute the date, using the [Now](/docs/count) function as the reference point

3. **Save and View**: After saving, the date will be displayed in the builder
