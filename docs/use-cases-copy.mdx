Marble allows you to cover a wide range of risk and AML use cases by using our templates or creating your own rules to verify transactions, users or even custom events.

# Transactions

*Card transactions, instant SEPA, request to pay, direct debit, regular SEPA transfers…*

Leverage our real time or batch scenario capabilities to monitor all kinds of money movements.

Examples of rules to implement:

* **Velocity** rules based on tokens, IBANs, BINs, IP, phone numbers …
* **Deviation** rules comparing an amount to its historical averages, percentiles…
* **Familiarity** rules counting, for examples, the number of times an IBAN has been used in the past
* **Custom or external lists** to flag risky keywords, blacklisted IBANs or card tokens, higher risk counterparts, countries flagged by the GAFI…
* **Context analysis** to detect **abnormal activities** by reviewing the users, accounts, and all recent events linked to the transactions

# Users

*Individuals, companies, non-profits…*

One of the basics of AML monitoring is to check **whether your users’ actual activity is in line with what you expect of them** and detect any notable change that should be investigated.

Cross-analyze your data and detect :

* Changes in transaction volume, origin or destination patterns
* Fast movements emptying the account or to multiple accounts
* Unexplainable cross border transfers
* Unknown device fingerprint

# Events

*Signups, new beneficiaries, profile updates…*

We recognize that not all risky events are transactions and let you create as many custom events as you need. Give it a name, declare how it relates to at least one object of Marble’s data model and you’re ready to go!

Creating custom events will help you:

* Detect account takeovers, unauthorized profile sharings, Xpay frauds, and many more before a transaction is even initiated!
* Refine your transaction and user monitoring scenarios to lower the number of false positives
