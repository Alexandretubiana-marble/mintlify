Marble allows you to receive webhooks to be notified when something happens. This allows you synchronize data in your systems or set up side effects (workflows) on specific actions.

At first, we provide webhooks only for a limited set of events, which will be expanded gradually.

Webhooks sending is not included in the open-source free plan.
