Focusing back in the field edition, a string or number type field can be marked as "enumerated". You should do this if you know in advance that the field will take values from a relatively small pool of distinct possible values.

Typically, a "status" field is likely to be enumerated, while a "value" or "account\_id" field most likely aren't.

If a field is marked as enumerated, we will keep track (within limits) of all the distinct values it takes. We will then display those values (or a subset of them) in the rule builder, as additional context for the builder using the field.
