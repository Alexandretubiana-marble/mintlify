# Introduction

The **Case Manager** is designed to provide analysts with a streamlined, focused, and efficient workspace for investigating fraud cases. With dynamic action panels, context-aware views, and powerful data exploration tools, it minimizes manual effort, enhances compliance, and lays the foundation for a more automated case management.

## Escalation

Escalate cases to a designated team inbox, ensuring seamless collaboration and proper routing.

* Define target inboxes in your [Inboxes Settings](/docs/configuration#inboxes)
* All escalations are traceable and auditable

***

## Assignment

Case ownership is designed to be intuitive:

* Click "Assign to myself" to set yourself as the owner of the case
* A case is automatically assigned to you when you take any action on it
* You can manually reassign a case to another team member when needed

***

## Case Statuses

Track and manage case progress with clear statuses:

* **Pending** – not yet assigned
* **In Progress** – currently under review
* **Closed** – investigation completed

***

## Detection Feedback

When closing a case, you will be able to chose one of the following outcome:

* **False Positive**
* **Valuable Alert**
* **Risk Confirmed**

These labels could be used to train your own ML algorithm for example.

***

## Case tag

Add a tag to the case to organize your investigations. You will need to create the tags you want from the [Tags settings](/docs/configuration#tags), and can then modify its name or color at any time.

***

## Next Unassigned Case

Speed up your workflow with a **one-click shortcut** to the oldest unassigned case, allowing rapid triage without interruption.

***

## Case Snoozing

Postpone a case for later review with snoozing functionality: just specify a future reactivation date and the case will reappear at that time.

This is ideal for reminders or investigations requiring external input.

***

## Investigation Panel

See everything that happened on the case since its creation:

* Browse the full event history
* Filter by the event types that matter to you

***

## Alerts Table

Access every alert tied to a case:

* See key details available at a glance
* Detection rules sorted by relevance (highest score first)
* Expand panels for full alert insight, as you can see below, by clicking on "Open" when hovering an alert

## Rule Snoozing

Quickly snooze detection rules directly from the case manager to deactivate noisy rules temporarily. See more details in [Rule snoozes](/docs/rule-snoozes).

***

## Data Exploration

Conduct deep investigations with access to all objects linked to a customer or case:

* Get information about the object's pivot, and this pivot's pivot
* Browse transactions, accounts, users, or any data related to the triggering object

</Frame>

***

## Past Alerts

Access **alert history** for the same pivot object at the bottom of the right panel:

* View previous alert statuses
* Identify recurring risk patterns and context

***

## My Inbox

Click on **My inbox** on top your inboxes list to access your **dedicated personal inbox** that consolidates all cases assigned to you — regardless of their original shared inbox.

* View your investigations in one place
* Cases are prioritized by date and status for efficient triage

<Frame caption="Select &#x22;My inbox&#x22; to access all cases assigned to you">
