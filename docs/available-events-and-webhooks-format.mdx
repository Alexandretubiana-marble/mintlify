# Available events

All webhook events we handle have the format `{object_type}.{event_action}`.

Below is the full list of events we currently handle with webhooks:

* `case.updated`
* `case.created_manually`
* `case.created_from_workflow`
* `case.decisions_updated`
* `case.tags_updated`
* `case.comment_created`
* `case.file_created` (one or more files created)
* `case.rule_snooze_created`
* `case.decision_reviewed`
* `decision.created`

This list will be progressively expanded as we add new webhooks options. Please feel free to reach out to us if one specific type of webhook is critical to a workflow you want to implement, and we will discuss with you if we can prioritize it.

# Webhooks format

## Slim webhooks

For now, Marble only sends "slim" webhooks, that is to say webhooks that do not contain the full payload of the object on which the event happened. Upon reception of a webhook, it is then your responsibility to call our API to read any additional data required to handle the webhook.

The advantages are that implementing new types of webhooks is faster for us to deliver, and that no personally identifiable data transits the servers of our sub-contractor for webhooks sending.

The inconvenient is, of course, that you must call our API to act on most of the webhooks.

## Webhook payload content

The webhooks body payload is of the following format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "content": {
      "{object_type}": {
        "id": "d4e6aae1-d005-4734-9294-a85d16dd1683"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-07-25T13:43:47.888170937Z",
    "type": "{object_type}.{event_action}"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

We are keeping the option open to add more metadata (at the root level) and details on the event (in the "content") later.

In some cases, several object ids may be contained in the webhook content. For instance, the `case.decision_reviewed` webhook contains

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "content": {
      "case": {
        "id": "c455154b-3e6c-4a1b-92b2-96f005c9b130"
      },
      "decision": {
        "id": "54624b1f-1396-43e7-9c3a-58dc08ab3449"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-09-16T11:13:30.973546+02:00",
    "type": "case.decision_reviewed"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Webhook header content

The webhooks received contain 2 specific headers, alongside the regular http headers:

* `x-convoy-idempotency-key`: unique identifier of the webhook, can be used for idempotent handling of the webhook
* `webhooks-signature`: concatenation of a timestamp and a signature `t={unix_ts},v1={signature_1}`. For instance, the header could take the value `t=1721915034,v1=lWR1+4ro2KOi55lTYx8mJaT4YhtvR2WU1c5lI50Lyrw=`. Optionally, more signatures can be appended (separated by a comma) to allow seamless secret rotation (see next section).
