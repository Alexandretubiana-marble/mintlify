# Why Are They Useful?

Understanding the utility of functions is best illustrated through examples. By using functions, you can create variables to:

* **Check Recent Transactions**: Determine if a transaction occurred within the last 30 days.
* **Identify Significant Changes**: Verify if the current transaction is 200% higher than the average of past transactions.
* **Sanction List Matching**: Check if the sender's name closely matches a name on a sanctions list.
* **Detect Abnormal Activity**: Identify if the number of transactions has increased abnormally.

# How to use them?

You can create a function simply when setting up your rule:

1. Click on **Select an operand**
2. Hover **Functions** in the dropdown list
3. Pick the function you need for your rule
