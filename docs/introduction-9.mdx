Marble can be used to perform sanction checks, for instance in a context of authorizing bank transfers.

A sanction check can be configured as a special type of rule, part of a scenario. It is configured to force the outcome of a decision if there are any potential sanction hits to review.

Sanction checking with Marble uses the state of the art [Opensanctions](https://www.opensanctions.org/) engine under the hood, and is a premium offering of Marble - get in touch with us to get a license key with access to sanction checking.
