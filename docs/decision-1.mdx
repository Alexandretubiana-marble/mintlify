With Trigger and Rules defined, a scenario evaluation results in a global score that can be tedious to interpret: the amplitude of scores evolves over the lifetime of a scenario, and different scenarios may use different scales for scoring.

In the Marble mental model, a decision is characterized by an Outcome, which can be: **Approve**, **Review**, **Block and Review** or **Decline**. This approach is more convenient for use in decision workflows.

To illustrate this, consider these examples:

1. Decision taken by a scenario triggered for each card transaction payout:

   * **Approve:** This triggers a frictionless transaction approval.
   * **Review:** This triggers a 3DS challenge.
   * **Decline:** This declines the transaction.

2. Decision taken by a scenario triggered for each SEPA transaction payout:

   * **Approve:** This triggers a frictionless transaction approval.
   * **Block and Review:** This suspends the transaction and requires a manual review ([here](/docs/blocking-review) to learn more on this use case)
   * **Decline:** This declines the transaction.

To convert the global score into an outcome, a scenario defines three thresholds:

1. A maximum score until which the outcome will be Approve.
2. A maximum score until which the outcome will be Review.
3. A maximum score until which the outcome will be Block and Review.

<Info>
  You can adjust thresholds in order to use up to the 4 possible outcomes. **Approve** and **Decline** are always used, but **Review** and **Block and Review** can be selected depending on the scenario use case.

You can adapt these thresholds during the lifetime of a scenario. Adding rules may raise the global score, and you can change thresholds to curate the outcome without impacting workflows based on those outcomes.
