# Definition

The formula is at the heart of the product. Users define formulas to specify the core of a scenario. Formulas are utilized in various areas, such as:

* Trigger conditions
* Rule creation
* Variable filters

A formula is built using [Operand](/docs/operand-picker) and [Operator](/docs/operator) concepts.

# How to create a valid formula

A formula is a set of conditions, each defined by a valid operation that evaluates to a boolean value. Formula builders allow you to:

* Add conditions
* Remove existing conditions
* Nest conditions

You can define formulas in multiple places, but the most important ones are the trigger and rule formulas.

## Trigger

<Info />

A trigger is a set of conditions. You can view the trigger as a logical AND operation that combines the results of each individual condition.

In this example, the second condition is invalid: the operation evaluates to a number which is not a boolean.

## Rule

<Info />

A rule is a set of group, each defined by a set of conditions. You can view the rule as a logical OR operation, each OR operand being a AND logical operation.

In this example, the second block is incomplete (require at least one condition). In practice, you need to delete the second block or define a valid condition.
