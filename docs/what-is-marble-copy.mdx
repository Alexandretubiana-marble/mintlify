Marble is the **open-source real-time fraud and compliance decision engine** specifically designed **for fintechs, financial institutions,** and any company moving money as part of its core business.

We allow risk teams to create their detection models and quickly react to new threats, all in no code and without having to rely on engineers, by allowing them to:

1. Access all the data they need by syncing their database with Marbleâ€™s data model.
2. Create their own rules, grouped in scenarios.
3. Run them in real-time to catch fraud on the fly or in batches to conduct periodic reviews.
4. Measure, optimize, iterate, and report!
