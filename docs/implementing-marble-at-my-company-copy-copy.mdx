As with any other project, you'll need a team that's in charge of the implementation. Typically, you'll want the following roles in the team:

* Champion : They'll drive the implementation to success, coordinating stakeholders and tech teams. Usually, that will also be Marble's first user, from the compliance team.
* Compliance or risks: someone in charge of the risk framework, that will actively contribute to the detection scenarios
* Tech lead : Ideally in charge of (or at least fluent with) the part of your stack that handles transactions, and/or the current tool used for monitoring them.
* A Project/Product Manager : They will be able to scope and prioritize the work needed to integrate Marble.
