[Lists](/docs/lists-in-scenario-builder) are useful when combined with specific [Operators](/docs/operator):

* **contains any of**: Checks if any of the list elements are present in the string.

  * `"elem" contains any of ["el", "abc"]` is `true` because `"elem"` contains `"el"`
  * `"elem" contains any of ["element", "abc"]` is `false` because `"el"` doesn't contain `"elemn"` or `"abc"`

* **does not contain any of**: Checks if none of the list elements are present in the string.
  * returns the opposite of the above evaluation

* **is in**: Checks if the specified element is present in the list.

  * `"elem" is in ["element", "abc"]` is `false` because `"elem"` is not an element of the list
  * `"elem" contains any of ["elem", "abc"]` is `true` because `"elem"` is an element of the list

* **not in**: Checks if the specified element is not present in the list.
  * returns the opposite of the above evaluation

| Operator                    | Left operand | Right operand   |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| **contains any of**         | string       | List of strings |
| **does not contain any of** | string       | List of strings |
| **is in**                   | string       | List of strings |
| **not in**                  | string       | List of strings |

<Warning>
  The **contains any of**, **does not contain any of** operators are not case sensitive, while the **is in** and **not in** operators are case sensitive.
</Warning>
