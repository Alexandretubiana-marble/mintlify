Now, it's time to shift our focus to real-time decisions. We'll maintain our existing asynchronous decision-making processes and integrate the real-time decisions API for time-sensitive decisions.

* Certain decisions will still be executed on a schedule.
* Others will be made in real-time to trigger specific actions in your product.

This advancement unlocks use cases such as:

* Real-time transaction monitoring, directly within the critical path of the transaction.
* Live user monitoring, during or after onboarding processes.

## Real-Time Scenario

Before proceeding with decision-making, let's create a scenario specifically tailored for real-time decisions. We'll focus on monitoring outgoing transactions where the payment method is a card (`direction = PAYOUT` and `payment_method = CARD`):

Following our previous steps, let's create the following rules:

* Verify if the card token is listed in the token blocklist.
  * This requires maintaining a list of known blocked tokens.

* Determine if the card has been utilized more than once in the last 24 hours, with a total amount exceeding €100.

* Assess if the card originates from a high-risk country, with a transaction amount exceeding €30.
  * This necessitates maintaining a list of known high-risk countries.

* Validate if the card belongs to a low-risk French bank BIN and the transaction amount is less than €80.

  * This rule will result in a negative score, indicating a lower risk.
  * Maintaining a list of known low-risk bank BINs is essential.

* Ascertain if the card has been used more than three times in the last two hours.

Finally, we'll define the following outcomes, each mapped to a specific action in our system:

* 0-20: Approve (This will trigger frictionless transaction approval).
* 20-80: Review (This will initiate a 3DS challenge).
* Over 80: Decline (This will reject the transaction).

## Real-time Decisions

To enable real-time decision-making, you'll need the assistance of your development team once again. They'll likely want to refer to our public [decisions API](/reference/post_decisions) documentation. Similar to the previous step, there's also data-model-aware documentation available in the [Marble UI](https://app.checkmarble.com/data).

At this stage, you'll likely need to integrate Marble into your core banking system.

Let's build upon the scenario we just created:

1. A card authorization request reaches your product

2. Your product undergoes the existing required checks (e.g., ensuring the user has sufficient funds).

3. You create a decision in Marble using the [decisions API](/reference/decision)

4. Depending on the decision's outcome, you trigger specific actions in your product. As a reminder of our intentions when building the scenario:

   1. **Approve**: Triggers frictionless transaction approval.
   2. **Review**: Internally initiates a 3DS challenge.
   3. **Decline**: Internally rejects the transaction.

In this scenario, setting up real-time decision-making is more intricate, but you typically handle the response programmatically, in real-time, eliminating the need for further steps.

## Recap

Congratulations, you have now successfully gone through a full-fledge Marble implementation !

From here, you can always edit your scenarios while keeping a clear audit trail, and you can also have a look at our case manager, which allows you to handle manual reviews on accounts or transactions.
