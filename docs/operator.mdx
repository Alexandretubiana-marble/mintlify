# Definition

An operator represents an action that combines two provided operands into a single result.

An operation involves:

* Restrictions on the types and number of operands.
* Restrictions on the type of the resulting value.

During the editing process, the builder may raise errors if these constraints are not met. Review the error messages to resolve these issues.
