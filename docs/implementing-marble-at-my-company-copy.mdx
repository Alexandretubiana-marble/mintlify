Marble's integration aims to enable real-time decision-making. For instance, you can decide to accept or decline a credit card payment based on the transaction itself and other user data points, such as past transactions, customer profiles, and related events.

While this ultimate goal remains paramount, we recommend an iterative approach to integration, starting with smaller-scale use cases. Here are the three steps we typically suggest:

1. **Proof-of-Concept**: Begin with manual CSV loading, user-triggered, or batch processing.
2. **Autonomous Decision Generation with Marble**: Progress to API-based ingestion with batch or user-triggered processing.
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Aim for API ingestion with real-time, API-triggered processing.
