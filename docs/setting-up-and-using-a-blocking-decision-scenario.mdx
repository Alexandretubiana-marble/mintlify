## Configure a blocking scenario

The scenario should be set up with the **Block and Review** outcome (learn more about outcomes [here](/docs/decision-1)).

Blocked decisions require a manual review within a case to ensure human oversight and maintain an audit trail.

<Info>
  You can configure a [workflow](/docs/introduction-5) to automatically attach every blocked decision to a case for review.

## Manually review a blocked decision

Any user of the organisation that is a member of the inbox may review blocked decisions contained in a case of that inbox.

When a blocked decision is reviewed, a [webhook](/docs/introduction-3) event is dispatched, letting any subscriber react to blocked decision reviews.

## List all blocked decisions pending for reviews

To avoid having unreviewed blocked decisions, you can view all pending blocked decisions in the decisions tab.
