Marble is a generalist decision engine, that can be adapted to serve different business use cases: synchronous authorization of operations, asynchronous review of accounts following events on the account, periodic account reviews, etc.

In some use cases, such as the blocking review of bank transfers, operators of the decision engine may want to manually review a decision in the case manager, before triggering a side effect in their systems (e.g. canceling or unblocking a pending bank transfer).

Possible use cases include:

* blocking outgoing payments until background checks have been performed, e.g. sanctions checks
* putting incoming payments on hold before releasing funds, pending investigation
* locking user accounts for a period of time, following trigger events

or any other workflow that requires the automatic status update of entities on the customer side following a decision in the Marble case manager.

The following page focuses on how to set up and use a scenario with a blocking review step, using the Marble case manager.
